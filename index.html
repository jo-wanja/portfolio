      <h1>I'm Josephine Nyambura, a web developer <i><i class="fa fa-laptop" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></h1>
      <p>I write code & bring ideas to life in the internet.All the  while making them beautiful in the process.</p>

      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I'm currently based in Nakuru-Kenya,a city with great views and wildlife.My educational background is in Engineering but i got interested in tech while still in school and after graduating, I decided to pursue it as a career.
        I started out as a digital markerter, went on to SEO analytics, and now i've finally landed on web development
        I decided to take this course because I think it will complement the other skills i've acquired in my journey across the tech world,and collectively, these skills will help me get/create a career that will allow me to support myself and my family.
        <ul>when, i'm not learning code, i engage in my other interests which include:
          <li>reading mostly fantasy</li>
          <li>listening to music</li>
          <li>taking long walks</li>
          <li>listening to podcasts</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
